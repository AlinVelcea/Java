Working with inheritances:

There are 3 main categories of vehicles: OnRoad, OnAir and OnWater that inherit the Vehicle class.

The Vehicle class has three fields: serial number, number of persons and the name of the vehicles.

Each child class/sub-class will have the overwritten methods of the vehicle class.

We also have a main class where we will test each methods.
