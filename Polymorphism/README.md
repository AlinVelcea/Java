1. STATIC POLYMORPHISM
- Polymorphism that is resolved during compiler time is known as static polymorphism. Method overloading is an example of compile time polymorphism.
- I have Address class - where I implement static polymorphism - and Main class - where I test Address class

2. DYNAMIC POLYMORPHISM
- Dynamic polymorphism is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime, thats why it is called runtime polymorphism.
- I have one super-class - Animal - and 3 sub-classes - Bear, Dog, Horse - where I overridden one method. Also, Main class with tests.

3. TECH
- here the objectiv is to use composition and aggregation
- in this exercise we have to "make" a smartphone and "build" its architecture
- we have several classes, each with a different behavior - example: Smartphone, Screen, Speaker, Microphone, Case, Pixel, Dimensions.
